    # Inline render leaves the folder path at new_search, so Kodi reloads this route when
    # returning from playback. Plain inline then re-popped the keyboard, and (issue #1)
    # cancelling it hung at "Working..." (route returned without end_of_directory) until
    # CScriptRunner killed the script after 12 min.
    #
    # Fix: remember the entered query in a window property. On the post-playback reload the
    # property is set -> re-render the previous results instead of re-prompting. The search
    # menus clear the property before "New Search" is reachable, so a deliberate new search
    # still prompts. An empty/cancelled keyboard ends the directory cleanly (no hang).
